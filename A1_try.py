In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€Ÿs 
play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C 
students play football. Write a Python program using functions 
to compute following: 
a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not 
both 
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not 
badminton
